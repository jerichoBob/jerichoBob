- 👋 Hi, I’m @jerichoBob
- 🌱 After a career in hardware and software development, I am now a first year graduate student studying Physics @ NCSU in Raleigh NC!
   - (I also work with BUILT (https://builtglobal.com) as a systems architect)
- My primary academic interests are (but not limited to) General Relativity, Gravitational Waves, Galactic Formation, Dark Matter.
- I am a recreational coder (in various languages, primarily in React these days) but love system design and architecture.
- I am also a HUGE fan of Blender (https://www.blender.org).
