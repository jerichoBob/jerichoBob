- 👋 Hi, I’m Bob 👋
- I currently work with a group of crazy / cool / innovative builders @ [BUILT](https://builtglobal.com) as a CTO Advisor/Consulting Architect ❤️❤️

- 🌱 Most recently, and after [several decades 😁](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobse/) in hardware & software systems development, I went back to being a student and this past May (2024) received my Masters of Science in Physics @ NCSU in Raleigh NC (https://physics.sciences.ncsu.edu/people/bob-seaton/) 😀🤓 - one of the highlights of my life.
  
- While earning my degree, I had the privilege of working in Dr. Rongmon Bordoloi's astrophysics research group. We focused on observational astrophysics, studying celestial objects like stars, galaxies, galactic clusters, and quasars based solely on the light captured by our telescopes. It's remarkable how much information about these distant objects can be gleaned from analyzing the electromagnetic spectrum.

- My first job out of college was building hardware / software systems for researchers at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. That was my first real-world taste of A/D converters, signal analysis, control theory, distributed systems, and... surgery -- Incredible collection of life/tech-lessons learned there (forever grateful to John Hall, PhD!). I aso quickly found out that I didn't have the stomach to be in medicine 🤣.

- I started my career writing tests for the 68040 processor, building out an automated test infrastructure for that silicon; I've been hooked on the value of good test methodologies ever since.
- I love to build things which means that I also like to code (in various languages, primarily in React and Python these days) and I LOVE the process and explanatory power of system design and (good) architecture. I came to Python late in life, but now it is both a tool I use in CGM research and in the exploration of generative AI systems. But I still feel like this more than I would like: https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python_environment_2x.png

- I am also a HUGE fan of Blender (https://www.blender.org) ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
