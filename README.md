- 👋 Hi, I’m Bob Seaton (@jerichoBob)
- 🌱 After a [career](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobse/) in hardware & software development, I am now a second year graduate student studying Physics @ NCSU in Raleigh NC (https://physics.sciences.ncsu.edu/people/bob-seaton/) 😀🤓
- I also work with the innovative builders @ [BUILT](https://builtglobal.com) as an advisor/consultant/architect ❤️❤️
- My primary academic interests are (but not limited to) observational and theoretical astrosphysics: Galactic Formation/Evolution, the Circumgalactic Medium/Damped Lyman alpha systems, General Relativity, Gravitational Waves. It still amazes me how we can study something at a scale so large in both space and time.
- I am a recreational coder (in various languages, primarily in React and Python these days) and I LOVE the process and explanatory power of system design and (good) architecture. I came to Python late in life, but now it is both a tool I use in CGM research and in the exploration of generative AI systems.
- I am also a HUGE fan of Blender (https://www.blender.org).
