Hey, I'm Bob.

Currently, I'm a CTO Advisor/Consulting Architect @ BUILT, where I help organizations leverage AI to transform their product delivery and customer experiences – but only when traditional software development won't cut it.

My journey's been wonderfully non-linear: from building hardware/software systems for medical researchers and testing silicon for the 68040 processor, to recently earning my M.S. in Physics from NCSU (2024). While there, I worked in observational astrophysics, studying distant celestial objects through the stories their light tells us.

I'm a builder at heart – whether it's coding in React and Python, designing systems architecture, or creating in Blender. Each career pivot has added a unique perspective to how I approach problems and innovation.
