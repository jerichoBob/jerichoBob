- 👋 Hi, I’m Bob 👋
- 🌱 After [several decades 😁](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobse/) in hardware & software development, I went back to being a student and got my Masters of Science in Physics @ NCSU in Raleigh NC (https://physics.sciences.ncsu.edu/people/bob-seaton/) 😀🤓 - one of the highlights of my life.
- I now work with a group of crazy cool innovative builders @ [BUILT](https://builtglobal.com) as a CTO Advisor/Consulting Architect ❤️❤️
- I started my career writing tests for the 68040 processor, building out an automated test infrastructure for that silicon; I've been hooked on the value of good test methodologies ever since.
- While getting my degree I had the priviledge of working in Rongmon Bordoloi's astrophysics research group, doing observational astrophysics (studying stars, galaxies, galactic clusters, quasars, etc) based solely on the light that comes to our telescopes: its quite remarkable the amount of information contained in the electromagnetic spectrum.
- I love to build things which means that I also like to code (in various languages, primarily in React and Python these days) and I LOVE the process and explanatory power of system design and (good) architecture. I came to Python late in life, but now it is both a tool I use in CGM research and in the exploration of generative AI systems. But I still feel like this more than I would like: https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python_environment_2x.png
- I am also a HUGE fan of Blender (https://www.blender.org) ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
