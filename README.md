- 👋 Hi, I’m @jerichoBob
- 🌱 After a career in hardware and software development, I am now a first year graduate student studying Physics @ NCSU in Raleigh NC!
- My primary interests are (but not limited to) General Relativity, Gravitational Waves, Galactic Formation, Dark Matter.
- I am a recreational coder (in various languages, primarily in javascript these days) but love system design and architecture.
